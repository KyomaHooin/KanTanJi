# Kanji Input

Always, when some key is required, it can be present only once in the row. Optional keys can be present multiple times.
It is also not important what order the keys are defined in. With kanjis, ID rows must be unique. Each tango (word)
then uses the same ID as kanji it belongs to.

> **SPARSE SUPPORT** -- input supports many features like significance levels, formats.. but for output to truly respect
> given feature, it must implement its usage. That means you can for example use markdown or significance 
> level on a kanji 'imi' value, but it will not likely change anything in the output, since
> kanji packs nor PDFs nor any other output generator expects you to adjust kanji meaning with these.
>
> **REQUIRED PROPERTIES** -- are required only for elements that take part in generated output.
> If you define kanji like ``kanji  |  協`` entry and nothing more, unless the kanji is used in
> non-ignored output for processing, it can stay like this.
> 
> Definition
>  - KEY **optional**
>    - SUBKEY **required**

> Means that ``KEY`` is optional; if specified, SUBKEY is mandatory.

### Minimal Example:
```
kanji   思   imi     myslet (emotivní)
kanji   思   tango   思＜おも＞う         imi    myslet, věřit (něčemu)
```

### Key definitions - Data

Dependening on the keys mentioned above, the row also can or must define other keys:
 - kanji - if used and *tango* not present, the row defines a kanji entry, the value is used as a kanji ID
   - imi - **required**, the meaning of the kanji symbol
   - onyomi - the onyomi reading, optional, defined once per unique reading, supports also multiple readings separated by japanese comma ('、')
   - kunyomi - the kunyomi reading, optional, defined once per unique reading, supports also multiple readings separated by japanese comma ('、')
 - tango - if used, row treated as a vocabulary kanji
   - kanji - **required**, the reference to the kanji value 
   - imi - **required**, the meaning of the vocabulary entry
   - tsukaikata - an example usage sentence, optional
   - raberu - vocabulary property, optional, supports one of:
     - ``tadoushi``  - transitive verb
     - `jidoushi`  - intransitive verb
     - `ichidan`  - る-verb, 1 form 
     - `godan` - 5 form verb
     -  ``suru`` - if a 'suru' verb appears, no need to specify any of the above
     - ``na``  - na-adjective
     - `i`  - i-adjective 
     - `fukisokuna` - irregular reading
     - `meishi` - noun, usually not specified except when it is not obvious the vocabulary is noun, too

You can also define arbitrary key-value pairs you wish, these will be included in 'other', 'notes' etc. sections.

#### Example:
```
ID     185      tango      思＜おも＞う       imi         myslet, věřit (něčemu)        raberu        godan        raberu     tadoushi         tsukaikata        そうだと思＜おも＞います。　Myslím, že je to tak.
-- OR --
ID     185      tango      思＜おも＞う       imi         myslet, věřit (něčemu)       tsukaikata        そうだと思＜おも＞います。　Myslím, že je to tak.         備<び>考<こう>      Jedná se o spíše 'emoční' než racionální myšlení.        tsukaikata        彼＜かれ＞のことをよく思＜おも＞っています。　Vážím si ho / Mám o něm vysoké mínění.
```
Both entries have different qualities. It is better to provide verb with information about its transitiveness and type.
The second example provides two usage examples to emphasise different use than in the 'to omou' grammar. Furthermore, it defines
custom **key** ``備<び>考<こう>`` which means 'note' and will be displayed in the 'extra' fields of the verb information section.

### Key definitions - Datasets

All datasets by default create learning content ``sets`` based on files they are stored in.
If you need to have two kanji order learning datasets, you can define the other one by using

 - setto
   - id - **required**, the set ID
   - subid - **optional**, defines a subset ID (order), if present the set defines a subset in the 'main' set (see example below)
     - junban - **required**, defines the order
     - ids - **required**, the ID set to compose a new dataset from (kanji values), if missing
     it is the name of the dataset itself (see example)

Example:
````
ID    1   setto    My Awesome Dataset
ID    1   setto    1-20            subid  1           junban    1            ids      図,思, 大, 教
````
Will create dataset _My Awesome Dataset_ with 1-20 kanji set name that contain two kanjis: 184 and 181.

It won't create a dataset by the file name
it occurs in. Rather, the dataset name comes from the value of the key `setto` and it defines
by ``ids`` what kanji IDs are to be included. These can be defined as comma separated
list of **existing kanji** letters.

### Key definitions - Metadata
``kanji`` and `tango` types are present in the _data_ used to generate output files. However, 
the app also supports arbitrary _metadata_. Each metadata row must be unique ID and type, there can
be two rows with the same ID if they differ in ``type``.

So, if you want to for example use radicals you can
define them in the very same way as you would other items, and if your desired generator
respects this metadata, it will be used along the data to enhance the outputs! Following
row keys - ``type``s - are supported:

 - radical - value of the radical
   - id - **required**, arbitrary ID to reference radical values later on
   - imi - **required**, the meaning of the kanji symbol
   - kunyomi - **optional**
 

Unlike data, these metadata entries are available across all data items - they can be defined
once _anywhere_. We recommend therefore defining such data in separate sheets to not
to mix them with data entries - they will be later hard to find! KanTanJi can in this case
respect the type as a filename: if you do not put any _data_ rows in some file, such file
will not be treated as a daat source file, and thus it will not generate any direct outputs (pdf learning materials, anki decks...).

### Referencing Metadata
Any row can reference another row by the ``type`` and `ID` values. Referencing radical thus works
like key-value pair: ``ref`` - ``redical-3``, which says that given row references radical with ID 3.

### Furigana
Firugana is crucial part of learning kanji. Here, any value (except the 'kanji' value itself) and also custom keys support furigana in the following way:

 - furigana on single kanji character `外＜がい＞人＜じん＞`　will add furigana to each character separately, which creates the best furigana where it is obvious
what character has which reading
 - kanji that canont be separated to individual readings can be defined as `＜大人＞＜おとな＞` where the furigana will be added as a centered group above the 
whole vocabulary element - the word; note that there must not be a space anywhere between `><` characters

### Importance of Entries - Key Marks
Every single key supports importance marks, for example `tango-`. This is also a 'tango' key, but it has one level less importance status, because
there are is a minus sign. It is up to the application (PDF / Anki ...) whether its generator interprets these importance levels in any way, or 
ignores them completely. For example, HTML sheets might respect `tango-` as less relevant vocabulary entry and show it to the users, but ignore `imi---` since there
is exactly one such key required, and it does not make much sense to have 'less important meaning'. `ID` importance marks are ignored completely.

### Importance of ``kanji`` and `setto`
Importance levels on 'key' identifiers - ``kanji`` and `setto` has additional meaning - such datasets will NOT be
part of the output data. You can therefore remove certain kanji and/or vocabulary item from the rendering process,
but still have it defined in the data. Similarly, you can define dataset, but prevent it from being generated.

Usecases are: temporary or contextual removal of 'too many vocabulary entries', or support for automated
vocabulary importance sorting. See below.

### Automated importance of ``tango``
This sorting depends on known 'kanjis' - if a word contains learnt kanji,
it will get the highest importance score. If there is a kanji that will appear in the same set, it
gets ``tango-`` importance level. If the kanji will be learnt 'sometimes in the future', it receives 
``tango--`` level. This is very handy for making students learn only vocab that contains learnt kanji symbols.
However, in order to work, all sets must be defined from the beginning!
````
ID  1   setto   My New Dataset
ID  1	setto	81-160	    IDS  	図, 工, 教, 晴, 思, ...
````
the above will not properly sort vocabulary, since the set starts with 81nth kanji - students probably learnt a bit more
already. What you can do, though, is to define kanji entries for ``一, 二, 三, 四, 五, ...`` 
(do not apply small significance here!) like so:
````
kanji  一
kanji  二
kanji  三
...
````
nothing more! Although for example ``imi`` is required, it is not needed here since we won't be using the kanji directly.
Now:
````
ID  1   setto   My New Dataset
ID  1	setto-	1-80	   IDS  	一, 二, 三, 四, 五, ...
ID  1	setto	81-160	   IDS  	図, 工, 教, 晴, 思, ...
````
will make set 1-80 ignored for the processing, but references will stay. Previous kanjis will be found and vocabulary
correctly sorted. Once you decide to also populate the first set with proper data, you can simply remove the minus sign.

## Example Data and Output

## Formats
Data input is by default a plaintext intput. Keys can encode also format in case the value is not a plaintext.
The usage is: ``[format]key`` followed by `value` in the given format.
Supported formats are:
 - plaintext (default)
 - markdown ``[md]``

# Data Providers
The following data providers are supported. Some might need additional setup to use - they just provide
the data and might behave in very different ways.

## Google Sheets
To integrate wit google sheets and GitHub actions, you have to:

 - Create Project
 - Enable services: Goole Sheets API & Google Drive API
 - Create Service Account
 - Share the folder that hosts files with the target service account email

## Test Data
Test data is meant for testing. Such data is stored in ``/misc`` folder
and is used when no other source is configured. In that case, the application
does not overwrite any files it would normally generate (update README etc.), 
but creates only ``.test`` folder with test output & prints readme contents to stdout.

# Advanced: Writing New Data Source
To provide new data source, one must ensure that the data comes in tabular form 
described above. Such data must be then returned in the following dictionary (shown one entry,
all sheets must be attached like this):

````python
data_name = "name used for the output files, typicall range of kanji characters it provides info about"
output[data_name] = {
     "data": the_tabular_data,
     "id": the_unique_data_id_unchanged_even_when_data_name_changes,
     "name": data_name
}
````

# Advanced: Writing new Output Generator
Output generator needs to implement one function (`generate`):

````python
def generate(key, data, metadata, folder_getter):
    # First, check whether any data was modified, and if not, exit to spare resources
    data_modified = data["modified"]
    radicals = metadata.get["radical"] # Note that metadata is not guaranteed to be present, only if at least one radical entry was present in the data!
    radicals_set_modified = radicals is not None and radicals["modified"]
    
    if not data_modified or not radicals or not radicals_set_modified:
       return False
    
    # Use folder_getter to generate proper output location. In this folder, output a file suitable for your output type
    output_filename = f"{folder_getter(key)}/{key}.apkg"  # example for anki deck

    # Now, generate your output and store it in output_filename. You can also create multiple files if it is desirable.
    ...

    # Return True if files were created, False if nothing was generated for some reason
    return True
````
``folder_getter(key)`` is folder where all files of the same key (~dataset) remain.

Integration of this function is not yet automatic, therefore ``main.py`` must be modified
accordingly. This is going to be changed in the future.
